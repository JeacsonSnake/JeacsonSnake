# 关于 / About

- 👋 你好，我是已经本科毕业的 Jeacson_Snake，拥有工学学士学位与理学学士学位。
- 🌱 我励志成为一名无论是硬件还是软件、前端还是后端，机械的组装到电路板的设计等什么都会一些的工程师，目前准备前往香港留学，希望能与你相剑。
- 🎨 我在本科所学习的专业是自动化，但是该专业的方向主要偏向控制类，该专业主要学习与机器人、嵌入式系统相关的控制类课程，当然这其中也有许多与“电子信息工程”专业相同的课程。**注意： 各个学校专业课程设置不同，仅供参考！**
- 💬 通过自学以及大学本科的相关课程，我学习了如何使用JAVA/Python/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/C++/Objective-C 等计算机语言在包括但不限于树莓派/ARDUINO/PC等设备上进行编程。
- 🤔 我拥有多个自建的网站：
  - 📝 我拥有一个博客，虽然之前因为挂载在 Github Pages 上使得它在中国大陆境内较难访问，不过我已经通过相关DNS服务对其进行托管，因此你可以在 [这里](https://blog.jeacsonsnake.com/) 直接访问。博客更新时间不定时，更新内容包括但不限于：前后端相关\计算机网络相关\嵌入式相关\机器人相关\自己发的小牢骚\甚至各种自己感兴趣但用处不是很大的的边角料知识。
  - 🎲 博饼网站：此项目是旧项目 `bobing-jettonman` 的整合版本，在原来项目的基础上添加相关代码，以实现纯前端的博饼版本。你可以点击 [这里](https://bobing.jeacsonsnake.com/) 进行访问。
  - ❔ 之后应该还会有其他网站输出，不过因为目前我还没有什么新的灵感，因此暂且搁置。
- 😢 我的毕业设计是通过使用轻量神经网络MobilenetV3实现一个基于树莓派的钢琴键盘演奏机器人，由于代码没有上传到 github，而且我不小心重装了 respberryPiOS，咱找不到原始代码了，有点遗憾。。
- 📫 您可以通过 Jeacson_Snake@outlook.com 与我联系。

- 👋 Hey there, This is Jeacson_Snake who has undergraduated with a Bachelor of Engineering and a Bachelor of Science.
- 🌱 I'm motivated to become an engineer who knows a bit of everything whether it's hardware or software, front-end or back-end, mechanical assembly to board design, etc., I'm currently prepare for further education in Hongkong, where I'm looking for communicate with you in.
- 🎨 The name of my major in undergraduate is "Robotics and Intelligent Devices", which focuses on control courses related to robotics and embedded systems, but of course there are also many courses in the same subject as "Electronic Engineering". **Attention: Individual universities may have different programmes for majors with the same name, so this is for reference only!**
- 💬 Through self-study and university undergraduate courses, I have learnt how to use computer languages such as JAVA/Python/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/C++/Objective-C to program on devices including, but not limited to, Raspberry Pi/ARDUINO/PCs.
- 🤔 I have a number of self-built websites (here's one of them, Although they were mainly written in Chinese): 
  - 📝 Blog: I own a blog and it's a pleasure for me to invite you check it out [here](https://blog.jeacsonsnake.com/). Blog update time is not regular, update content including but not limited to: front and back-end related \ computer network related \ embedded related \ robotics related \ their own little whining \ and even a variety of their own interest but not very useful side knowledge.
  - 🎲 Bobbing website: This project is a consolidated version of the old project `bobing-jettonman`, adding relevant code on top of the original project to realise a pure front-end bobing version. You can access it from [here](https://bobing.jeacsonsnake.com/).
  - ❔ There should be other website outputs after that, but since I don't have any new inspirations at the moment, I'm putting them on hold.
- 😢 My Final Year Project was to implement a piano keyboard playing robot based on Raspberry Pi 5 by using the lightweight neural network *MobilenetV3*, as the code doesn't being uploaded to github and I accidently reinstall my respberryPiOS, I can hardly find my original code. Which is kinda regret.
- 📫 You can make a contact with me at Jeacson_Snake@outlook.com
